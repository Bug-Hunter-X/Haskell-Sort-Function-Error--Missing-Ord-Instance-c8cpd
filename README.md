This example demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  The `sort` function requires that the type of elements being sorted have an instance of the `Ord` typeclass.  This typeclass defines the ordering relation (<, <=, ==, >=, >) for the type.  If you try to sort a list of a custom data type without defining an `Ord` instance for that type, the compiler will report an error.  The solution shows how to add an `Ord` instance to fix this.
